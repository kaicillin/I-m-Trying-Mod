## Info
This Minecraft mod was coded for a Hackclub event (Hackcraft), and I have not yet had the chance to add everything I wanted or properly troubleshoot, but I will be either updating this one when I am done or creating a new mod with all the features!

These are for a project of mines, for a custom server so they have some lore purposes (although they may seem random) that I am not sharing yet.

## Added into this mod as of right now (May, 2025) are:

- Custom Particles: Le_Apis (The Bee), Le Particles (The Particles), Regina Apis(Queen Bee), Innocens Anima(Innocent Soul), Acendens Anima(Ascending Soul), Perfectum Anima (Mature Soul) 

The particles have backstory behind them too, but this mod was made with a semi specific use in mind.

- Custom Blocks: 
  - Le Spin, something that is just decor for now. I want to be able to have it throw/toss and spin players, but that is a future feature
  - Water Lilies, these are just a 3x3 sized block of water lilies.
  - Test Block, a block that has exclamation points and is otherwise clear. It may be used to surround testing sites.
  - Two Block, silly named block that is purple, and forms the edge of a cube, with see through walls(?)

- Custom Items
  - Test Thing, a item that is... simply the iconic Ranboo smile!
